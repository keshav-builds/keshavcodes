Being shortlisted for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 Grand Finale** is an electrifying experience. Leading a team of six has been a wild mix of collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving. Here’s my playbook to help you get there too — practical, simple, and straight from the trenches.

## Build Your Dream Team With Six Members

A six-member team hits the sweet spot. Cover all bases — coding, hardware (if needed), UI/UX design, and presentation skills. The right mix makes your solution stronger and teamwork smoother.

## Choose Problems Smartly — Passion Plus Strategy

Don’t limit yourself to just one problem statement. SIH lets you submit for multiple challenges, so go for it!

**Pick the problem you like the most** — passion drives the best work. Then, look at  submission numbers: problems with fewer submissions usually have a better chance of shortlisting. It’s a smart strategy to balance interest with opportunity.

Once you pick the problem(s), give your project a cool, memorable name. Something like **EcoGuard** — Environmental pollution detection & alert system. It sticks in minds and makes your project easy to recall.

If any term confuses you, don’t hesitate to ask AI or look it up.

**Pro tip:** Even if you’re a beginner, don’t hesitate to submit your PPT. SIH is for everyone, no matter your level. Just try — every submission is a win in experience.

## Stick to the Official PPT Template — Less Is More

Download the official SIH PPT template and stick to it. Don’t mess with background, fonts, or colors — they gave you that template for a reason!

## Make Your Cover Page Shine — Your Front Door to Impress

The first page is your golden ticket. Divide it nicely — team details, problem statement, project name. Add icons or illustrations to make it welcoming. A clean and attractive cover page sets a great first impression.

## Simplify Your Flowcharts — Explain Like You’re Talking to Your Grandma

Your flowcharts should be so simple that *anyone* can understand. Use basic shapes and arrows, make each step clear.

## Think Like an Evaluator — Cover Every Angle

Map out all the potential use cases and edge cases your solution covers. It shows you’re thorough and creative. Even a brief mention in your PPT makes a difference.


## Don’t Just Tell, Show — Make a Video Demo

PPTs are good, but a short **video demo** takes you a notch higher. Whether it’s a screen recording or hardware setup, a demo brings your idea alive. Add the video link in your PPT, so evaluators can see your hard work in action.

## Build a Prototype — Make Your Idea Real

Whether it’s a basic UI or a hardware assembly photo, a prototype counts as proof. It shows your solution isn’t just theory — you’ve made something real or close to real. Add those images to your presentation.

## Speak the Language of Innovation — Use Trendy Tech Buzzwords

SIH’s submission filters love terms like AI, IoT, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Edge Computing. Use them naturally in your PPT, but keep your tone human and genuine — no robotic jargon.
